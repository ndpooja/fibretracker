# Frequently Asked Questions

## viz.orthogonal and viz.slicer are not showing output

Make sure to run **%matplotlib widget** alongwith other library

## How models.track_fibres works ?

models.track_fibres either requires detected coordinates **coords** or normalized volume **vol**. It is suggested to use both if calculated coords available during smoothening to avoid re-compute.

## Can I use it locally on the laptop or PC?

Yes, this library works locally and does not need very high computing power to use it. Load depends on memory size of data which you are going to use.
